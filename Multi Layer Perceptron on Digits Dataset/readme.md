Here, I have Multi-Layer Prceptron Classifier from the Scikit-Learn library in python on the Digits Dataset from Kaggle. Appropriate parameter tuning and optimization has been done.

Links for the dataset:

Dataset :- https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data

Description: - https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer

The classifier was able to obtain 96.029% accuracy. Furthur parameter tuning can be done in order to increase it.

(P.S.- I have also trained a XGBoost Claasifier in the given file, though parameter tuning has not been done)
