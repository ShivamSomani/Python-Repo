This project is for a basic movie recommender in Python using graphlab library.

The dataset for the movies, users and user ratings has been taken from the following link:

 http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/

The following are the features of this dataset:

1. 100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies.
   
2. Each user has rated at least 20 movies.
  
3. Simple demographic info for the users (age, gender, occupation, zip)
   
4. Genre information of movies

2 types of recommendations have been used and compared in this project:

1. Popularity Based Recommendations

2. Item Based Recommendations

For item based recommendations also, 3 similarity functions have been considered:

1. Pearson Similarity

2. Cosine Similarity

3. Jaccard Similarity

In the end, the precision and recall parameters of all these recommenders have been compared.
