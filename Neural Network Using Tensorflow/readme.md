The given file aims to build up a Neural Network using the Tensorflow library. The dataset which has been taken for this project is the House Price Prediction dataset. It has been firstly preprocessed  by taking only 2 features instead of 4 and only the first 10 values for training the model in order to to keep the model simple. 
The labels- 0 and 1 have been randomly assigned to each of the tuples to indicate that whether the house is a good buy or not. The cost function which has been taken for the minimization is the Root Mean Squared Error function which is being minimized through the Gradient Descent Algorithm.
