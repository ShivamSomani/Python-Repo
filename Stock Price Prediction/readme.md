# Stock Price Prediction In Python

This is a basic project for Stock Price prediction of 3 companies namely Google, Apple and Facebook using the Regression Models.

The data for the stock prices of the company for the last one year has been taken up from Google Finance.

The project aims to predict the stock prices for the next 7 days upto which the data is available for the companies.

Here, we have introduced 2 new parameters in order to predict the stock prices which are as follows:

1.Spread

2.Percentage Change

Many more parameters can also be calculated from the data in order to make the Regression Models more accurate. A number of Regression models from the Scikit-Learn Library have been trained on the data and the models with the best scores have been optimized furthur using GridSearchCV in order to obtain more accuracy.

In the end, the dates and the stock price after next 7 days for the company have been plotted using Matplotlib. The project's functionality can be extended by introducing more features and calculating the stock prices for shorter spans of time to get more accuracy.
